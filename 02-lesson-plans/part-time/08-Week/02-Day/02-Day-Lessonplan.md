## 8.2 Lesson Plan - Project Week

### Overview

In this class, students will continue working on their API Projects. 

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should continue working on their Projects.

* Students should be introduced to the concept of Git Branching and Pull requests. 

##### Instructor Notes

* In today's class, students will continue working on their projects for the entirety of the day. 

* Instructors: You will once again use the "small group" workshop format if possible to introduce students to the concept of Git Pull Requests. This is best taught in "small group" format, so groups can concentrate on their projects instead of being slowed down by students unable to grasp the concept or utility of a Pull Request. Consider students' comprehension of Pull Requests to be secondary to the main goal of completing their projects. Keep your sessions on Git Pull Requests to under 20 minutes for each group. 

* During your sessions on Git Pull requests, use the [Git PullGuide](Supplemental/GitPullGuide.docx) to help steer the process. Be sure to slack this guide out to students after you've introduced them to the concept. Additionally, check out the [GitVisualized](Slide-Shows) slide deck as well. Use your discretion, as to whether or not you review this slide deck with students. It can be helpful in that it provides a visual to the concept of branching. However, if you think it will take too much time to discuss -- feel free to nix it in favor of a "practice makes perfect" line.
