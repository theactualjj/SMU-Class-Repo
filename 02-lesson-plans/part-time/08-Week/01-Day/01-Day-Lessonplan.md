## 8.1 Lesson Plan - Project Week

### Overview

In this class, students will begin work on their first Project of the Bootcamp, an API-powered web application that pulls data from multiple sources in a creative way. 

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should be introduced to the goals and requirements of Project #1. 

* Students should be given the entire class day to identify a project idea, research APIs, and begin initial work outlining their design.

* Each group should submit a Project Proposal by the end of the day.

##### Instructor Notes

* Today's class is all about introducing students to their first project and giving them plenty of time to "scope" out their final goal. 

* As Instructors / TAs, keep in mind that the success of your students post-bootcamp is largely dictated by the quality of their projects. Encourage and help steer them in every way you can towards high-quality final projects! 

* Instructors / TAs, take a few moments before class to review the presentations posted on this link: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe80S_8KApqOTw-2-b-sgzTwwWImepoii>. Do not share these with students as they are Rutgers Specific -- however, use the insight you gain in watching these videos to understand what's possible. 

* The schedule for Project #1 is as follows:

  * Day 1 (Today): 

    * Students are introduced to Project Week, its goals, and requirements. 
    * Students work with Instructors / TAs to identify feasible projects. 
    * Students submit a Project Proposal

  * Day 2:

    * Students are given all of class to work on Projects
    * Instructors + TAs work closely with groups to offer "code assistance"
	
  * Day 3:

    * Students are given all of class to work on Projects

  * Day 4 (Next Week)

    * Students are given rest of class to work on Projects

  * Day 5:

    * Students are given rest of class to work on Projects
    * Students begin planning their final presentations
	
  * Day 6:
    * Students present their final project! 

* Today, at your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups. In these workshops, student groups will rotate between the Instructor and TAs to get help on specific topics like "Refining Ideas", "Finding the Right API", "Creating a Layout", etc. These workshops should be between 10-20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction. (Note: This approach works best if you can physically remove students from the main classroom and find small spaces to work with individual groups. Be creative here!).

### Class Objectives

* To introduce students to Project Week, its timeline, and the deliverable requirements

* To provide students an opportunity to brainstorm project ideas and obtain instructor approval for project direction.

- - -

### 1. Instructor Do: Present the Project Week Slideshow (25 mins)

* Open up the `API_Project_Week_1.pptx` file and present each of the slides. Use the `Teams` slide as a cue for breaking students up into teams. 

* Slack out the `API_Project_Week_1.pptx` file and the `API_Resources.docx` file. 

* Remind students that they will need to complete a half page proposal to instructors by EOD. Let them know that they can just slack you the file. (This doesn't need to be kept for official purposes. It is merely so you have a way to review their final plans for feasibility sake).

### 2. Students Brainstorm (70 mins)

* Students begin work with groups to identify ideas, research APIs, and create project designs. 

* At the your discretion, Instructor/TA should begin hosting "workshops" to help steer groups in the right direction.

### 3. BREAK (15 min)

### 4. Students Brainstorm (80 min)

* Students continue working with groups to identify ideas, research APIs, and create project designs. 

* Instructor / TAs should continue their workshop series. 

### 5. Instructors Do (10 min)

* Review any overarching questions and offer closing thoughts.
